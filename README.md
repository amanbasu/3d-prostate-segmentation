# Introduction

- Prostate cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed and leading causes of cancer related death in developed countries.
- The early detection of prostate cancer plays a significant role in the success of treatment and outcome.
- Radiologists first segment the prostate image from ultrasound image and then identify the hypoechoic regions which are more likely to exhibit cancer and should be considered for biopsy.
- Manual segmentation consumes considerable time and effort and is not only operator-dependent, but also tedious and repetitious.
- In this work we present an appraoch to segment prostate using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks without requiring the involvement of an expert.
- We were able to obtain results comparable to the state-of-the-art, with the average Dice loss of 0.92 and 0.80 on train and validataion set respectively.

# Data

- In MRI images, the voxel intensities and therefore appearance characteristics of the prostate can greatly differ between acquisition protocols, field strengths and scanners.
- Therefore a segmentation algorithm designed for use in clinical practice needs to deal with these issues.
- We decided to use the data from PROMISE12 challenge which included the scans from four different centers 
    - Haukeland University Hospital (HK), Norway
    - Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), United States
    - University College London (UCL), United Kingdom
    - Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC), Netherlands. 
- Each of the centers provided <b>25 transverse T2-weighted MR images</b>. This resulted in a total of <b>100</b> MR images. 
- Details pertaining to the acquisition can be found in the table below.

# Implementation

We used a modified V-net architecture for segmentation shown in the figure below.

# Training
We trained our model on different GPUs and got the following speedups.

| GPU configuration | Batch Size    | Average Time per Epoch (s) |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single K80        | 2             | 147                        |
| Dual k80          | 2 (1 per GPU) | 102                        |
| Single P100       | 2             | 48                         |
| Single P100       | 5             | 27                         |

## Evaluation Metrics

The metrics used in this study are widely used for the evaluation of segmentation algorithms:
1. <b>Dice coefficient</b>: To measure the similarity between output volumes.
2. <b>Absolute relative volume difference</b>: the percentage of the absolute difference between the volumes.
3. <b>Average boundary distance</b>: the average over the shortest distances between the boundary points of the volumes.
4. <b>95% Hausdorff distance</b>: the maximum of the shortest distances between the boundary points of the volumes. 95% percentile makes the metric less sensitive to outliers.

# Results

After training for 5700 epochs we got a dice loss of 0.94 and 0.87 on training and validation set. The results were then submitted to the MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge, and we received a score of <b>84.61</b> on the test set.
